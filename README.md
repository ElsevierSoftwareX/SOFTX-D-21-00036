# DynaProg
Solve multi-stage deterministic decision problems.

## Purpose
DynaProg is a MATLAB toolbox to solve a finite horizon multi-stage deterministic decision problem, which is a problem where a decision must be made at each stage for a system that evolves through a finite number of stages, minimizing the total cost incurred.

## Installing DynaProg
There are two ways to use DynaProg:
- Download the toolbox from MATLAB File Exchange,
- Download the source code.

### Install the toolbox
The most straightforward way to install DynaProg is to directly install it from MATLAB's Add-on explorer or from the [File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/84260-dynaprog).
Doing this also installs the documentation in MATLAB's Help Browser.

### Download the source code
Alternitavely, you can simply clone the git repository. Then, add the `src` folder to your MATLAB's search path. This method is recommended if you want to inspect/modify the source code.

Doing this will not install the documentation in MATLAB's Help Browser. You can still visualize it with any web browser: browse to the `src/html` folder and open `index.html`.

## Licensing
DynaProg is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

Some of the examples packaged with the toolbox make use of data derived from the [ADVISOR(R) Software](https://sourceforge.net/p/adv-vehicle-sim/code/HEAD/tree/).
